# Christmas Delivery Coding Game

Deliver presents to houses full of children by writing JavaScript code.

## Motivation

The idea behind this is highly inspired by [The Elevator Saga](https://github.com/magwo/elevatorsaga), a coding game I came across some time ago.
I also wanted to see how it is to develop a game in an agile, test driven way with React and Redux, most of which are not that common for game development.
Last but not least, I wanted to see how long it takes me to write a game like this.

## Local development

This project can be installed with `npm install`, started with `npm start` and tested with `npm test`.
